# Car_Shop
## General
This is a Mini-Swift project for my school semester. Feel free to copy the code :)

## Description
This is a simple Car-Shop project, where the user can search for a specific car and add 
the chosen car into a buy-list. The cars are going to be loaded from the "https://carapi.app/" API.

### Warning
This is not an app where you can literally buy a car. It's just a project to improve my skills in Swift-App Devolopment!
